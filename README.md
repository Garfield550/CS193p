# About CS193p

Content from [Stanford's CS193p about site](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/about-cs193p):

> Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS, explains the fundamentals of how to build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI. Most recently offered in Spring quarter 2021, the lectures were given to Stanford students in an on-line format due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and are now available to all via Stanford's YouTube channel.

> SwiftUI is fairly new, having shipped just over a year before this course was taught. Thus it may well be that by the time you are watching it, some of the course's content will already be out of date as updates to SwiftUI occur, requiring some adjustment as you watch. That is normal for new technology.

> The material in this course was not developed with the involvement of, nor was it vetted by, anyone at Apple, so it should not be perceived as "the truth" for how to develop using SwiftUI. We've done our best to understand this technology ourselves in the short time it has been out and then share what we've learned. Enjoy!
